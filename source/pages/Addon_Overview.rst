What is Game Rig Tools?
-----------------------

**Game Rig Tools** (**GRT** for short) is a set of utilities for Blender. With it, you can easily prepare a complex rig for export to game engines. Whether you work with Unreal Engine, Unity, Godot, or another modern engine, the GRT techniques will work flawlessly.  

The add-on was developed by `BlenderBoi <https://blendermarket.com/creators/blenderboi/?ref=356>`_ based on workflows by `CGDive <https://www.youtube.com/c/CGDive/>`_.


Key Features
------------

Generate a Game Rig from an existing Control Rig
************************************************
    
The addon can extract a **Game rig** (a.k.a. **Deform** **Rig**) from your **Control Rig** with a few clicks. 

The **Control Rig** can be a Rigify rig or another complex armature that makes use of any number of Drivers, Constraints, etc. 

The extracted **Deform rig** is a simplified version of your control rig (generally the Deform bones). It can easily be exported to game engines. It has an optimized number of bones, is free of scale issues, and can have any bone hierarchy you desire.

Action Bakery - easily bake Actions from the Control Rig to the Deform Rig
**************************************************************************
    
Having your armature split into Game Rig and Control rig has a lot of benefits. However, one major drawback is that animations need to be "**baked**" to the Game Rig before they can be exported out. Baking many actions by hand is time-consuming. 

Luckily the "**Action Bakery**" is part of Game Rig Tools. Just select all the Actions that you want to bake, click a button and the add-on does the rest of the work for you.
